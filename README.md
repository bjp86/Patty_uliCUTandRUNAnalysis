uliCUT&RUNAnalysis Analysis Pipeline

Description
ultra-low input Cleavage Under Target and Release Using Nuclease(uliCUT&RUN) is a variant of the CUT&RUN technique developed by the Henikoff group, with key modifications that decrease background signal, increase output, and lower the amount of input material needed to successfully profile chromatin-associated protein localization at single cell or embryo resolution. The data analysis described herein is a basic uliCUT&RUN bioformatic pipeline that step-by-step guides the user to process raw fastq files into occupancy visualization plots and perform binding motif analysis at factor-occupied regions of interest. THis analysis requires a basic understanding of UNIX commands but can be run on a standard computing cluster. For advanced users, we suggests alternatives to the programs and packages used in this analysis in the accompanying manuscript that could serve as a starting point for a custom analysis pipeline.

Requirements

FastQC, v0.11.9

Pipeline Usage

1. FastQC.bash
Input: Raw paired fastq files
Output: Html fastq quality assessment report

2. bowtie2.bash

Input: Quality-assessed paired fastq files

Output: Paired end sequence alignment map (SAM) files for sample and spike-in 

3. picard.bash

Input: Paired end sample SAM files

Output: Paired end sample SAM files filtered of PCR duplicates and reads MAPQ<10 and text file containing lengths of all reads within sample and spike-in SAMs.

3.5. Fragment Distribution profile generation with desired spread sheet program

Input: Text files of fragment lenths of reads in sample and spike-in SAMs

Output Fragment Distribution profile

4. size_class.bash with bowtie2.header

Input: Filtered sample SAM files 

Output: Size-class filtered sample binary aligment map (BAM) files

5. deepTools.bash and/or homer_motif_calling.bash

For deepTools.bash:

Input: Size-class filtered sample BAM files and text file

Output: DeepTools-generated heatmap and metaplot visualizations of factor over regions of interest

For homer_motif_analysis:

Input: Size-class filtered sample BAM files 

Output: HOMER-generated Motif matrix for factor-occupied regions of interest
